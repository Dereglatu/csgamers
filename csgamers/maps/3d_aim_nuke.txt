3D_AIM_NUKE

By: Squirrelly


A recreation of nuke's lobby, upper site & outside area. Nuke is also a very popular maps & i thought
it had a great layout for an aim map, althought it was very difficult, I really made sure this map was 
an exact replica of the original map, texture for texture, brush for brush, lighting, etc... This map 
has been done for quiet awhile & very anticipated by the public but was always under wraps until its
release date. Team3d has been practicing and enjoying these maps for awhile & gave them to many professional teams, so hopefull you all will too! Enjoy!
