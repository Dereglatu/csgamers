I just love the cs map "de_train"...and i decided to make one myself...only insted of "de_"  I made it "fy_"...it's small...and good for playing 5 vs 5, plus that I keept the rendering down...thank's to the creator of the original map "de_train" for where i got my inspiration, and to the creator of the wads file "bdog" and "noname"...that helped me alought. 

I payed a good attention to he detalies on the map, and the gameplay, in my opinion it's very balanced.

I made many other maps, from "fy_" to "de_", if this map has succes i'll sumbit others :P


If anyone want's to ask something about the map...just contact me at my Y!M adress "  NO_LIMIT_ADEON....or by mail : no_limit_adeon@yahoo.com"
