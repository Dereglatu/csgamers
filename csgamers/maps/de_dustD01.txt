CT:
Counter Terrorists have to prevent the Terrorist
attack. The Terrorists will try to bomb one of the
nuclear drop zones.

Team members have to defuse any bomb that threatens
the nuclear drop zones.

T:
Terrorists which have the C4 charge will have to
destroy at lease one of the nuclear drop zones.

OTHER NOTES:
This is an alternative version of Dust II. 
Among the changes are the breakable arch doors 
that can now be destroyed by firing at them, 
the watch tower from the CT base, more player 
slots and other changes that you can discover 
yourself by playing the map.
