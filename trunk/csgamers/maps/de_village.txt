Background: A terrorist organization has
decided to give an ultimatum to the french
government: They're going to bomb a village
if their comrades aren't released from jail.
The problem is it can be any village in
France. Fortunately, the OTAN has discovered
where, and they're sending a group of men to
catch them in fraganti.
 
Counter Terrorists: Prevent Terrorists from
bombing the threatened targeted areas.

Terrorists: Destroy either the main entrance or
the central square of the village.
